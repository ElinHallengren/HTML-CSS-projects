            <p>Food is many things. It is what gives us energy to do the things
                that we want to do. It is the building blocks to help us grow,
                both from child to adult, and to increase muscle mass, fat tissue,
                and blood. 
                Food can for many also be comfort, a friend when we are lonely,
                a way to show and recieve love.
            </p>
            <code><h1>Pro-tip</h1>
            <p>Food is neccessary to stay alive, but it can also be what is killing you.</p></code>
            <p>In this document food means the building blocks that is absorbed through
                the bowelsystem, and is what your whole body consists of.

            <p>Food consists of five major components. Three that are energy-giving and two 
                that are just as important, but they do not provide energy.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Carbohydrates</li>
                <li>Fat</li>
                <li>Protein</li>
                <li>Vitamins</li>
                <li>Minerals</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The first three, the energy-giving catagories, are what we will continue
                discussing. The last two, vitamins and minerals, are important for life, 
                and if you don't get enough of them, you will get very sick.
                In vitamins and minerals are also antioxidants included. In this document, we will 
                continue talking about the three energy-givers, how to properly combine them for proper 
                health and benefit.
            </p>
            <code><h1>Pro-tip</h1>
            <p>If you combine the energy-giving components correctly, there is no need
                to worry about vitamins and minerals, and there is no need to take suplements!
            </p></code>

            <p>Carbohydrates are our main energy source.</p>

                <p>Some fat is neccessary, but too much will make you store more fat.

            <p>Protein is the buildingblocks for our muscles, hormones and our immunesystem.</p>
            <code><h1>Pro-tip</h1>
                <p>Protein is where your focus should be if you want to stay full and still
                    lose fat tissue, whilst maintaining lean tissue.

            <p>Celebrate protein and have some with every meal!</p>
